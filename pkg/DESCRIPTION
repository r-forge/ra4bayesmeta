Description: Functionality for performing a principled reference analysis in the Bayesian normal-normal hierarchical model used for Bayesian meta-analysis, as described in Ott, Plummer and Roos (2021, "How vague is vague? How informative is informative? Reference analysis for Bayesian meta-analysis", under minor revision for Statistics in Medicine). Computes a reference posterior, induced by a minimally informative improper reference prior for the between-study (heterogeneity) standard deviation. Determines additional proper anti-conservative (and conservative) prior benchmarks. Includes functions for reference analyses at both the posterior and the prior level, which, given the data, quantify the informativeness of a heterogeneity prior of interest relative to the minimally informative reference prior and the proper prior benchmarks. The functions operate on data sets which are compatible with the 'bayesmeta' package on CRAN.
